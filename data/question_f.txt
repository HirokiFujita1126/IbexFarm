Did the young lady have a drink?
Was the boy in the kitchen?
Did the man take pictures?
Who smelt the flower?
Was the tie read?
Who had the umbrella?
Did the man hold the camera?
Did the lady look at the map?
Was there a policewoman?
Was the rabbit in the zoo?
Was the dog licking the cat?
Was the boy chasing the cat?
